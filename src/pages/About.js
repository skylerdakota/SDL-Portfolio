                  In search of a new challenge, in a field with high impact, Skyler leaves the hospitality industry where they served
                  as the Director of Operations for a start up beverage company. Inspired by the creative thinking and collaborative work
                  required of building a company from the ground up, Skyler aims to translate these skills into the tech industry.
